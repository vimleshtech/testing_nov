-OVerview Testing
-SDLC   : software development life cycle 
There are following phases of SDLC:
	pre: 
		Inception 

	i. Requirement Gathering & Analysis  : by Business Analyst (BA)
		outcome:	
		-SRS		: software requirement specification 
		-FR(FRS/FRD)	: functional requirement
		-BR(BRS/BRD)	: business requirement 
		
	ii. Design				: by Software Architect/Solution Architech
		-HLD : high level design(outer/ module wise design)	
		-LLD : low level design (inner/ functionalities of application)

	iii. Development/Coding		: by software developer 
		-convert design to executable code 
	iv. Testing/QA/SQT		: by software tester
		Level of testing:
		i. Unit Testing			: by Developer 
		ii. Integration testing		: by Tester 
		iii. System testing		: by Tester 
		iv. UAT(user acceptence testing) : by Customer/user/client 

		
		
	v.  Release			
			-Handover the product to client 

	after:
		maintainance
